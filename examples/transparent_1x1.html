<?
	//
	//  You might use this code in the following way:
	//
	//  You have a client to which you are passing one of your users.
	//  The user is being presented with a form to fill out.  When the
	//  user completes the form you want to somehow also record that
	//  the user completed the form.  So you create a file called:
	//
	//  	form_complete.html
	//
	//  And tell your client to add this image tag to their page:
	//
	// 	<IMG SRC="http://your.domain.com/form_complete.html?user=x">
	//
	//  You then code a bunch of PHP (perhaps some code that talks to
	//  a MySQL database) to record the form completion in your database.
	//  When the request comes to form_complete.html, you add a row in
	//  a database specifying the user name as $x.  You then cut and
	//  paste this code and what's returned to the user is a completely
	//  invisible transparent image.
	//
	//  Note: this code produces an image that is 1x1 and 43 bytes large.
	//  It's tiny and unnoticeable.
	//

                $description = imagick_faileddescription( $handle ) ;

                print "handle failed!<BR>\nReason: $reason<BR>\nDescription: $description<BR>\n" ;
                exit ;
        }
